# rusty-structures
An experimental data structures and algorithms library. The implementations are usually reading from books/blogs/papers and rewriting them in Rust. The credits can be find below.

### Existing structures

- priority queue ([1](https://github.com/mlarocca/AlgorithmsAndDataStructuresInAction))
    Will be moved to seperate crate
- bloom filter ([1](https://github.com/mlarocca/AlgorithmsAndDataStructuresInAction))
    Will be rechecked, not working correctly right now
- simple bloom filter ([1](https://www.manning.com/books/algorithms-and-data-structures-for-massive-datasets))
    Will be moved to seperate crate, after bloom filter is fixed
- quotient filter ([1](https://www.manning.com/books/algorithms-and-data-structures-for-massive-datasets), [2](https://www.gakhov.com/articles/quotient-filters.html))
    Under development
