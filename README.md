# rusty-structures
An experimental data structures and algorithms library. The implementations are usually rewriting already existing examples in Rust. The credits can be find below.

### Existing structures

- priority queue ([Source](https://github.com/mlarocca/AlgorithmsAndDataStructuresInAction))
- bloom filter ([Source](https://github.com/mlarocca/AlgorithmsAndDataStructuresInAction))
- simple bloom filter ([Source](https://www.manning.com/books/algorithms-and-data-structures-for-massive-datasets))
